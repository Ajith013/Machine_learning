## Welcome to Machine Learning Repository

You can go to [my github repository](https://github.com/Ajith013/Machine_learning) to view the basic implementation of Machine Learning algorithms. 

The algorithms currently implemented are :
1. Decision Tree
2. Logistic Regression (Along with implemntation of Cross validation method)
3. Naive Bayes
4. Support Vector Machines
